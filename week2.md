     BODY: This contains everything you want to display on the Web Page.

  <!DOCTYPE html>: This tag is used to tells the HTML version. This currently tells that the version is HTML 5.
    <html>: This is called HTML root element and used to wrap all the code.
    <head>: Head tag contains metadata, title, page CSS etc. All the HTML elements that can be used inside the <head> element are: 
            <style>
            <title>
            <base>

    <body>: Body tag is used to enclose all the data which a web page has from texts to links. All the content that you see rendered in the  browser is contained within this element.
